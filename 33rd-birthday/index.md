# On my 33rd Birthday


How time flies! I am 33 years old now and have lived in US for more than 10 years. 
I have also graduated from University of Utah
for almost 5 years now. Wahoo! Each week passed very quickly. 
Now is the time to pause a little bit and reflect what has been 
achieved and what could be done better. 

# Achievements
* Worked on a few projects/papers and made a few submissions to FAST/ATC/HotStorage, though none of them 
have been accepted yet. The D3 paper gets very close to be accepted by ATC18. 
* Mentored four interns. Really enjoyed working with some of them. 
* Learned a few new things: AWS S3/Azure, Golang, AWS serverless, and Spark.
* Successful collaboration with a few faculties, include Haryadi Gunawi and Feng Yan.
* Submitted the greencard application, though still waiting for VISA for approval.
* Bought a house at Fremont, CA and moved in in February this year.  

# Areas to improve
* Make a career plan and see where you want to go in the next ~5 years
and work diligently toward the goal.
* Systematically build your knowledge about storage systems. 
Read more documents/source code of existing storage techniques and systems. 
Do more hand-on experiments, trying/implementing these techniques/algorithms. 
Learning on the way.
