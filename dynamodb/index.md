# Amazon DynamoDB: A Scalable, Predictably Performant, and Fully Managed NoSQL Database Service


- Hundreds of thousands of customers rely on DynamoDB for its fundamen- tal properties

- In 2021, during the 66-hour Amazon Prime Day shopping event, Amazon systems - including Alexa, the Amazon.com sites, and Amazon fulfill- ment centers, made trillions of API calls to DynamoDB, peak- ing at 89.2 million requests per second, while experiencing high availability with single-digit millisecond performance.

- For DynamoDB customers, consistent performance at any scale is often more important than median request service times be- cause unexpectedly high latency requests can amplify through higher layers of applications that depend on DynamoDB and lead to a bad customer experience.
