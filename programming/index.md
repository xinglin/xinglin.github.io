## Quotes

1. Programming is (among other things) a practical skill that you need to practice to master.   
2. Learning involves repetition.  
3. You must run before you can walk! Babies really do run by themselves before they learn
the finer skills of slow, controlled walking. Similarly, you will dash ahead, occasionally stumbling, to get a feel of programming before slowing down to gain the necessary finer control and understanding.
